# Flatiron Frontend Phase 1 Project

## Description:

<p>This one-page web application collects beautiful art data from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and presents it for your enjoyment. Specifically, the application currently collects data from one artist Auguste Renoir. Upon arriving at the sight, you see the artist's name and a dropdown list. The list contains all titles for Renoir artwork available by Met Museum for which there is an associated digital image. After selecting a list item, the corresponding image displays. Upon clicking the rendered image, further details on the art piece are displayed below.</p>

<p>Future enhancements include searching for any artist by name and providing the above capabilities. Additional search criteria like period, region, department etc are planned in future upgrades.</p>
